    The last ArrayList method we are going to learn is... .add() again!
Except this time, instead of .add() taking one parameter
(the thing we want to add), this time, we will be giving it two parameters.
The two parameters are:

.add(i,element)
i ==> the index you want to insert at

element ==> the element you want to insert at index i
