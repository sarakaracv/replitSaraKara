public class Alphabet {
    /*
    Use a loop to print the alphabet from A to Z. Print all the characters in one line, with no spaces between them.
Also use another loop to print the alphabet from z to a. Print all the character in one line, with no spaces between them.
Note: There will be two lines in the output. One of the uppercase letters from A to Z, and a second line for the
lowercase letter from z to a.
Note: Do not just print the the characters as a String, use a loop to iterate through all the characters
Main topics: loops, primitive datatypes
