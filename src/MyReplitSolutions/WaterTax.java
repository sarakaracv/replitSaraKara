    Finish the method called waterTax() that will take a double units argument and returns a double bill cost.
    Use the given guidelines to calculate the bill cost based on the number of used units. The more water used,
    the more it will cost. The method is already called in the main method with arguments.
- If the units are under 50:
    bill = units * 0.60

- If the units are above 50:
    bill = units * 0.90

- If the units are above 100:
    the bill is the same as the above 50 units, but with an additional fee of $50

- If the units are above 150:
    the bill is the same as the above 50 units, but with an additional fee of $100
    This is a return method with a double parameter

Example: waterTax(50)
output:
  30.0
